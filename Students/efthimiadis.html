        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Miltos Efthimiadis, and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised in Nikaia, Piraeus, Greece, on July 17, 2004. I enjoy watching basketball, reading books, watching movies, and playing video games. I also have a strong interest in history and rap music. I completed my schooling in Nikaia before continuing on to university. Although I faced some difficulties choosing my career path, I believe I have now found my direction and aspire to become a programmer. </p>

I love the challenge of figuring out how things work and finding efficient solutions. Programming is not just a skill—it’s a way to think logically, be creative, and build projects that can have a real impact.</p>
