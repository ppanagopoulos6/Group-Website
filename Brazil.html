       <h1>Brazil</h1>
    </div>

    <h2 class="history">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Brazil, country of South America that occupies half the continent’s landmass. It is the fifth largest country in the world, exceeded in size only by Russia, Canada, China, and the United States, though its area is greater than that of the 48 conterminous U.S. states. Brazil faces the Atlantic Ocean along 4,600 miles (7,400 km) of coastline and shares more than 9,750 miles (15,700 km) of inland borders with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador specifically, Uruguay to the south; Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia to the southwest; Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana to the north. Brazil stretches roughly 2,700 miles (4,350 km) from north to south and from east to west to form a vast irregular triangle that encompasses a wide range of tropical and subtropical landscapes, including wetlands, savannas, plateaus, and low mountains. Brazil contains most of the Amazon River basin, which has the world’s largest river system and the world’s most-extensive virgin rainforest. The country contains no desert, high-mountain, or arctic environments.
    </p>

    <h2 class="history">Culture</h2>
    <p>
        The cultures of the Indigenous, Africans, and Portuguese have together formed the modern Brazilian way of life. The Portuguese culture is by far the dominant of these influences; from it Brazilians acquired their language, their main religion, and most of their customs. The Indigenous population is now statistically small, but Tupí-Guaraní, the language of many Indigenous Brazilians, continues to strongly influence the Brazilian Portuguese language; other Indigenous contributions to Brazilian culture are most apparent in the Amazon basin. African influences on the Brazilian way of life are strongest along the coast between the Northeast and Rio de Janeiro; they include traditional foods, religions, and popular music and dance, especially the samba. Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often competed with—and influenced—Brazilians’ own cultural output, and critics have argued that the nation’s cultural identity is suffering as a result. Despite numerous social and economic challenges, Brazilians continue to be exuberant and creative in their celebrations and art forms.
    </p>
    <p><b>Carnival</b>, the four day pre-Lenten Carnival is the most famous and exuberant Brazilian holiday. Carnival in Brazil is the traditional combination of a Roman Catholic festival with the lively celebrations of people of African ancestry. It evolved principally in urban coastal areas, notably in the former plantation zones along the coast between Recife and Rio de Janeiro.</p>

    <h2 class="food">Food/Cuisine</h2>
    
    <p><b>Feijoada </b> is considered Brazil’s national dish. It is a slow cooked stew made with black beans and different cuts of pork or beef. It is usually served with rice, collard greens, orange slices, and farofa, which is toasted cassava flour.</p>

    <p><b>Pão de queijo</b> are small cheese bread rolls that are crispy on the outside and soft inside. They are made with tapioca flour, which gives them a chewy texture. They are commonly eaten for breakfast or as a snack.</p>

    <p><b>Coxinha</b> is a popular street food snack shaped like a teardrop. It is made of shredded chicken wrapped in dough, then breaded and fried. It is crunchy on the outside and soft inside.</p>

    <p><b>Brigadeiro </b> is a traditional chocolate dessert made with condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter. The mixture is rolled into small balls and covered with chocolate sprinkles. It is very common at parties and celebrations.</p>

    <p><b>Farofa</b> is toasted cassava flour mixed with butter, onions, and sometimes eggs or meat. It is served as a side dish and adds crunch and flavor to meals like feijoada.</p>

    <p><b>Moqueca</b> (labeled as Brigadeiro in original text) is a flavorful seafood stew made with fish or shrimp, coconut milk, tomatoes, onions, and peppers. It is usually cooked slowly and served with rice. There are different regional versions across Brazil.</p>

    <p><b>Açaí na tigela</b> is a cold dish made from frozen açaí berries blended into a thick puree. It is often topped with fruit, granola, or honey. It is popular as a refreshing and energizing food.</p>

    <h2 class="history">History</h2>
    <p>
        North America’s first humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were settled before Canada, and that the Inuit who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada. There is general agreement that Native American peoples are related to Asian peoples and that the closest resemblances are between North American Arctic peoples and their counterparts in Siberia.
