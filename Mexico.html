       <h1>Mexico</h1>
    </div>

    <h2 class="history">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Mexico, country of southern North America and the third largest country in Latin America, after Brazil and Argentina. Mexican society is characterized by extremes of wealth and poverty, with a limited middle class wedged between an elite cadre of landowners and investors on the one hand and masses of rural and urban poor on the other. But in spite of the challenges it faces as a developing country, Mexico is one of the chief economic and political forces in Latin America. It has a dynamic industrial base, vast mineral resources, a wide-ranging service sector, and the world’s largest population of Spanish speakers—about two and a half times that of Spain or Colombia. As its official name suggests, the Estados Unidos Mexicanos (United Mexican States) incorporates 31 socially and physically diverse states and the Federal District.
    </p>

    <h2 class="history">Culture</h2>
    <p>
        Mexican society is ethnically and regionally diverse, and there are sharp socioeconomic divisions within the population. Many rural communities maintain strong allegiances to regions, often referred to as patrias chicas, which help to perpetuate cultural diversity. The large number of indigenous languages and customs, especially in the south, also accentuates cultural differences. However, indigenismo, or pride in the indigenous heritage, has been a major unifying theme of the country since the 1930s. In attempts to unite the country culturally by identifying a uniquely Mexican culture, the government has sometimes supported indigenous folk arts and crafts as well as the European-inspired classical arts.<b>Cinco de Mayo</b>,holiday celebrated on May 5 in parts of Mexico and the United States in honor of a military victory over the French forces of Napoleon III in 1862, known as the Battle of Puebla. Cinco de Mayo is not to be confused with Mexican Independence Day, which falls on September 16. The latter holiday was established in 1810, some 50 years before the Battle of Puebla occurred.

    <h2 class="food">Food/Cuisine</h2>
    
    <p><b>Tacos </b> are one of the most famous Mexican foods. They are made with soft or crispy tortillas filled with meats such as beef, chicken, pork, or fish. They are usually topped with onions, cilantro, salsa, and lime. Tacos are a major part of Mexican street food culture.</p>

    <p><b>Tamales </b> are made from corn dough called masa, filled with meat, cheese, or vegetables. The dough is wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves and then steamed. Tamales are often eaten during holidays and family celebrations.</p>

    <p><b>Enchiladas </b> are rolled tortillas filled with meat, cheese, or beans and covered in chili sauce. They are baked or cooked and often topped with cheese, sour cream, and onions. Different regions of Mexico have their own enchilada styles.</p>

    <p><b>Mole</b> is a rich and complex sauce made from chilies, spices, nuts, and sometimes chocolate. It is commonly served over chicken or turkey. Mole from Oaxaca is especially famous and can take many ingredients and hours to prepare.</p>

    <p><b>Pozole </b> is a traditional soup made with hominy corn and meat, usually pork or chicken. It is flavored with chilies and spices and served with toppings like cabbage, radishes, onion, and lime. Pozole is often eaten during celebrations.</p>

    <p><b>Quesadillas </b> are tortillas filled with melted cheese and sometimes meat or vegetables. They are cooked until the cheese melts and the tortilla is warm and slightly crispy. They are a popular snack or meal.</p>

    <p><b>Churros</b> are fried dough pastries coated in sugar and sometimes cinnamon. They are crispy on the outside and soft inside. Churros are often eaten as a dessert or snack and can be served with chocolate sauce.</p>

    <h2 class="history">History</h2>
    <p>
        It is assumed that the first inhabitants of Middle America were early American Indians, of Asian derivation, who migrated into the area at some time during the final stage of the Pleistocene Epoch. The date of their arrival in central Mexico remains speculative. The assertions of some archaeologists and linguists that early humans resided in Mexico some 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, before developing technology for big-game hunting, are rejected by most scholars. More generally accepted claims for early settlers in Mexico pertain to a somewhat later period and to hunters of large herd animals such as the mammoth. Human artifacts and mammoth bones dated to approximately 9000 bc have been found together in the same geologic strata in the Valley of Mexico at Santa Isabel Ixtapan.

    <h2 class="places-title">Sights/Attractions</h2>

    <h3>Teotihuacán</h3>
    <p> 
        Teotihuacán, the most important and largest city of pre-Aztec central Mexico, located about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of modern Mexico City. At its apogee (c. 500 ce), it encompassed some 8 square miles (20 square km) and supported a population estimated at 125,000–200,000, making it, at the time, one of the largest cities in the world. It was the region’s major economic as well as religious centre. Teotihuacán was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.

    <h3>Chichén Itzá</h3>
    <p>
        Chichén Itzá, ruined ancient Maya city occupying an area of 4 square miles (10 square km) in south-central Yucatán state, Mexico. It is thought to have been a religious, military, political, and commercial center that at its peak would have been home to 35,000 people. The site first saw settlers in 550, probably drawn there because of the easy access to water in the region via caves and sinkholes in limestone formations, known as cenotes.Chichén Itzá is located some 90 miles (150 km) east-northeast of Uxmal and 75 miles (120 km) east-southeast of the modern city of Mérida. The only source of water in the arid region around the site is from the cenotes. Two big cenotes on the site made it a suitable place for the city and gave it its name, from chi (“mouths”), chen (“wells”), and Itzá, the name of the Maya tribe that settled there. Chichén Itzá was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988.

        Visit in early November to join the Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebrations. Downtown Oaxaca de Juarez turns into a scene from a fairy tale with marigold-decorated altars and thousands of people donning la calaca (skeleton) facial paint. Art lovers can explore the nearby Benito Juárez Market to browse traditional Oaxacan crafts, like alebrijes (colorful spirit figurines) and handwoven rugs.
