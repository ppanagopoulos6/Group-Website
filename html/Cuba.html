    <h2 class="history">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Cuba, country of the West Indies, the largest single island of the archipelago, and one of the more-influential states of the Caribbean region.The domain of the Arawakan-speaking Taino, who had displaced even earlier inhabitants, Cuba was claimed by Christopher Columbus for Spain in 1492. It became the Spanish empire’s most-important source of raw sugar in the 18th century and later earned the sobriquet “Pearl of the Antilles.” Though Spain had to fight several difficult and costly campaigns against independence movements, it retained rule of Cuba until 1898, when it was defeated by the United States and Cuban forces in the Spanish-American War. Cuba soon gained formal independence, though it remained overshadowed by the nearby United States.
    </p>

    <h2 class="history">Culture</h2>
    <p>
        In general, Cuba is a country short of everything, though its people exhibit extraordinary resilience and inventiveness in the face of hardship. So skilled are they, for example, at keeping automobiles from the 1950s in good running and cosmetic condition that Cuba has become a destination of choice for vintage-car collectors from the United States and Europe. Still, the constant food shortages, electricity blackouts, and telephone breakdowns affect people in different ways. Most problems and opportunities are relative and constantly changing, except for the staples of life in Cuba—the inescapable control of the government, the Saturday-night movies on one of the two local television channels, the Monday-night telenovelas (soap operas) imported from Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, or Colombia, and the unavoidable preoccupations of work, home, and family. Socialist ideologies notwithstanding, lifestyles are not equal for everyone, and how one perceives Cuba varies considerably depending on one’s individual situation.

        Groups with access to hard currency—mainly U.S. dollars—enjoy a level of comfort not markedly different from that of middle-class residents elsewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean. From two-fifths to half of Cubans have access to dollars. This is a varied group indeed, comprising recipients of foreign remittances from their families, workers in service industries who receive gratuities, tourist enterprises catering to foreigners, members of the armed services, workers in some industries who are paid partly in dollars, and even those working in the sex trade. There is also a group, locally called mayimbes (bosses), who appear to enjoy a good life without the benefit of obvious employment. These people form the faithful local clientele at the upscale paladares, the family-style restaurants officially licensed since 1994; they also frequent elegant state-run restaurants and the international dining rooms, expensive boutiques, and disco clubs of some first-class hotels, as well as the Caracol and Cubalse “dollar stores” scattered throughout Havana and other resort towns. Dollars also enable ordinary Cubans to ameliorate, however slightly, the monotonous routine of their lives. They can supplement the inadequate supplies of their ration books—not only in quality but also in quantity and variety—from purchases in the mercados agropecuarios (general food markets) and creative private sources (including the black market).

    <h2 class="food">Food/Cuisine</h2>
    
    <p><b>Ropa vieja </b> is considered the national dish of Cuba. It is made from beef that is slow cooked until very tender, then shredded and simmered in a sauce made of tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, garlic, and spices. The name means old clothes because the shredded meat looks like fabric. It is usually served with white rice, black beans, and sometimes fried plantains. The dish reflects Spanish influence on Cuban cuisine.</p>

    <p><b>Moros y cristianos </b> is a classic Cuban rice and bean dish. Black beans are cooked with garlic, onions, and spices, then mixed with white rice. The name refers to the historical contrast between dark beans and white rice. It is eaten almost daily in Cuban households and often served alongside meat dishes like pork or beef.</p>

    <p><b>Lechón asado </b> is slow roasted pork that is very important in Cuban culture, especially during holidays and family celebrations. The pork is marinated in a citrus and garlic mixture called mojo, which gives it a strong and savory flavor. It is roasted until the meat is tender and the outside is crispy. It is commonly served with rice, beans, and yuca.</p>

    <p><b>Tostones </b> are made from green plantains that are sliced and fried, then flattened and fried again. This double frying makes them crispy on the outside and soft inside. They are lightly salted and often served as a side dish or snack. Tostones are very popular and are commonly eaten with meals or dipping sauces.</p>

    <p><b>Yuca con mojo</b>  is a simple but flavorful dish made from boiled yuca, a starchy root vegetable similar to cassava. The yuca is topped with mojo sauce made from garlic, citrus juice, and oil. This dish is often served as a side with pork or chicken. It is loved for its soft texture and bold garlic flavor.</p>

    <p><b>Picadillo </b> is a ground beef dish cooked with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spices. It often includes olives and sometimes raisins, which give it a mix of salty and slightly sweet flavors. Picadillo is commonly served with rice and beans and is a staple meal in many Cuban homes.</p>

    <p><b>Flan </b> is one of the most popular desserts in Cuba. It is made with eggs, milk or condensed milk, sugar, and caramel. The dessert has a smooth, creamy texture and a sweet caramel sauce on top. Flan is usually served chilled and is common at family gatherings and celebrations.</p>

    <h2 class="history">History</h2>
    <p>
        It is assumed that the first inhabitants of Middle America were early American Indians, of Asian derivation, who migrated into the area at some time during the final stage of the Pleistocene Epoch. The date of their arrival in central Mexico remains speculative. The assertions of some archaeologists and linguists that early humans resided in Mexico some 30,000 to 40,000 years ago, before developing technology for big-game hunting, are rejected by most scholars. More generally accepted claims for early settlers in Mexico pertain to a somewhat later period and to hunters of large herd animals such as the mammoth. Human artifacts and mammoth bones dated to approximately 9000 bc have been found together in the same geologic strata in the Valley of Mexico at Santa Isabel Ixtapan.
