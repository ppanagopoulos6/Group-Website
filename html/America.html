    </div>

    <h2 class="history">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are bounded on the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region created in 1790.

    <h2 class="places-title">Famous Sights</h2>

    <h3>Statue of Liberty</h3>
    <p>
        Statue of Liberty, formally Liberty Enlightening the World, colossal statue on Liberty Island in the Upper New York Bay, U.S., commemorating the friendship of the peoples of the United States and France. Standing 305 feet (93 meters) high including its pedestal, it represents a woman holding a torch in her raised right hand and a tablet bearing the adoption date of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) in her left. The torch, which measures 29 feet (8.8 meters) from the flame tip to the bottom of the handle, is accessible via a 42-foot (12.8-meter) service ladder inside the arm (this ascent was open to the public from 1886 to 1916).

    <h3>Grand Canyon</h3>
    <p>
        Grand Canyon, immense canyon cut by the Colorado River in the high plateau region of northwestern Arizona, U.S., noted for its fantastic shapes and coloration. The Grand Canyon lies in the southwestern portion of the Colorado Plateau, which occupies a large area of the southwestern United States and consists essentially of horizontal layered rocks and lava flows. The canyon is broad and intricately sculptured. Within its walls are an imposing array of canyons, buttes, and ravines. It is about 277 miles (446 km) long and ranges in width from 4 to 18 miles (6 to 29 km) and attains a depth of more than a mile (1.6 km).

    <h3>Mount Rushmore</h3>
    <p>
        Mount Rushmore National Memorial, colossal sculpture in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, U.S. It lies about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Rapid City, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Custer, and just north of Custer State Park. Huge representations of the heads of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, each about 60 feet (18 meters) tall, are carved in granite on the southeast side of Mount Rushmore. The mountain itself, at an elevation of 5,725 feet (1,745 meters), was named in 1885 for Charles E. Rushmore, a New York lawyer. The memorial, which covers 2 square miles (5 square km), was designated in 1925 and dedicated in 1927. The U.S. National Park Service (NPS) assumed administration of the site in 1933.

    <h2 class="places-title">General Tips</h2>
    <p>
        Always carry valid identification, especially when traveling between states or entering certain buildings. Tipping is expected in restaurants, cafes, taxis, and hotels. Distances between cities are large, so plan flights or long drives ahead of time. Follow local laws closely, as rules can vary by state. Weather can change a lot, so check forecasts before traveling.
