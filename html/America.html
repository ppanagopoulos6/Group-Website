        <h2 class="headers">Introduction</h2>
        <p>United States, country in North America, a federal republic of 50 states. Besides the 48 conterminous states that occupy the middle latitudes of the continent, the United States includes the state of Alaska, at the northwestern extreme of North America, and the island state of Hawaii, in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The conterminous states are bounded on the north by Canada, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The United States is the fourth largest country in the world in area (after Russia, Canada, and China). The national capital is Washington, which is coextensive with the District of Columbia, the federal capital region created in 1790.</p>
       
        <h2 class="headers">Culture</h2> 
        <p> The great art historian Sir Ernst Hans Josef Gombrich once wrote that there is really no such thing as “art”; there are only artists. This is a useful reminder to anyone studying, much less setting out to try to define, anything as big and varied as the culture of the United States. For the culture that endures in any country is made not by vast impersonal forces or by unfolding historical necessities but by uniquely talented men and women, one-of-a-kind people doing one thing at a time—doing what they can, or must. In the United States, particularly, where there is no more a truly “established” art than an established religion—no real academies, no real official art—culture is where one finds it, and many of the most gifted artists have chosen to make their art far from the parades and rallies of worldly life.Still, many, perhaps even most, American culture makers have not only found themselves, as all Americans do, caught in the common life of their country—they have chosen to make the common catch their common subject. Their involvement with the problems they share with their neighbors, near and far, has given their art a common shape and often a common substance.<p><b>Thanksgiving Day</b>, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. It is observed on the fourth Thursday in November in the United StatesThe American holiday is rich in legend and symbolism, and the traditional fare of the Thanksgiving meal typically includes turkey, bread stuffing, potatoes, cranberries, and pumpkin pie.Thanksgiving is a day when families and friends gather to express gratitude for the year’s blessings over a shared feast. The holiday has evolved from a harvest celebration to a national tradition of togetherness and thankfulness through centuries of tradition building, mythmaking, and cultural change.</p>

        <p><b>Independence Day</b>, in the United States, the annual celebration of nationhood held on July 4. It commemorates the passage of the Declaration of Independence by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. This document announced the separation of the 13 North American colonies from Great Britain. In 1870 the U.S. Congress made Independence Day an unpaid holiday for federal workers, and in 1938 it became a paid federal holiday. Also called the Fourth of July, the holiday is celebrated across the United States with parades, fireworks shows, picnics, concerts, and other festivities. Independence Day is also notable for its displays of patriotism, as many Americans commemorate the day by flying the American flag and dressing in the flag’s colors of red, white, and blue.</p>

        <p><b>Halloween</b>, a holiday observed annually on October 31 and noted for its pagan origins and its Christian roots as well as its secular traditions. In much of Europe and most of North America, observance of Halloween is today largely nonreligious, celebrated with parties, spooky costumes, pumpkin carvings called jack-o’-lanterns, and trick or treat. Halloween also marks the beginning of Allhallowtide, a Christian triduum (Latin: “period of three days”) dedicated to remembering the dead that begins with All Hallows’ Eve (October 31) and is followed by All Hallows’, or All Saints’, Day (November 1) and All Souls’ Day (November 2).</p>

        <h2 class="headers">Food/Cuisine</h2>
        <p>
        <b>Hamburger </b> is one of the most well known American foods. It usually consists of a grilled beef patty served in a bun with toppings such as lettuce, tomato, cheese, onions, and sauces. Hamburgers are common at restaurants, barbecues, and fast food places.</p>


        <p><b>Hot dog </b> is a sausage served inside a soft bun. It is often topped with ketchup, mustard, relish, or onions. Hot dogs are especially popular at sporting events, fairs, and cookouts.</p>


        <p><b>Fried chicken </b> is made by coating chicken pieces in seasoned flour and frying them until crispy and golden. It is known for its crunchy outside and juicy inside. This dish has strong roots in Southern American cuisine.</p>


        <p><b>Macaroni and cheese </b> is a comfort food made with cooked pasta and a creamy cheese sauce. It is often served as a side dish or a main meal. Many families have their own versions of this dish.</p>


        <p><b>American barbecue </b> includes slow cooked meats such as ribs, pulled pork, or brisket. The meat is often smoked and covered in barbecue sauce. Different regions of the United States have their own barbecue styles and flavors.</p>


        <p><b>Pizza </b> is very popular in the United States and has been adapted from Italian cuisine. American styles include New York style thin crust and Chicago deep dish pizza. It is commonly eaten as a casual meal or at social gatherings.</p>


        <p><b>Apple pie </b> is a classic American dessert made with baked apples, sugar, and spices inside a pastry crust. It is often served warm with ice cream. It is a symbol of American home cooking.</p>

            History
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            The territory represented by the continental United States had, of course, been discovered, perhaps several times, before the voyages of Christopher Columbus. When Columbus arrived, he found the New World inhabited by peoples who in all likelihood had originally come from the continent of Asia. Probably these first inhabitants had arrived 20,000 to 35,000 years before in a series of migrations from Asia to North America by way of the Bering Strait. By the time the first Europeans appeared, Indigenous people (commonly referred to as Indians) had spread and occupied all portions of the New World.

            Yellowstone National Park
        </h3>
        
        <p> 
            It is hard not to list this one first—the “mother park,” the country’s and world’s first national park. Occupying the northwest corner of Wyoming and slivers of eastern Idaho and southern Montana, Yellowstone is an enchanting place. The greatest draws are its hydrothermal features—the world’s largest collection of geysers (notably the renowned Old Faithful), colorful hot pools, mud cauldrons, and hot springs and terraces. But the park also features a beautiful lake, which occupies the cauldron of an ancient volcano, and a majestic two-tiered waterfall that is at the western end the spectacular Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River that features towering multihued rock formations. Herds of bison and elk roam the park, and Yellowstone is famous for its bears—and, since the 1990s, its packs of wolves.

            Statue of Liberty
        </h3>
        
        <p>
           Statue of Liberty, colossal statue on Liberty Island in the Upper New York Bay, U.S., commemorating the friendship of the peoples of the United States and France. Standing 305 feet (93 meters) high including its pedestal, it represents a woman holding a torch in her raised right hand and a tablet bearing the adoption date of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) in her left. The torch, which measures 29 feet (8.8 meters) from the flame tip to the bottom of the handle, is accessible via a 42-foot (12.8-meter) service ladder inside the arm (this ascent was open to the public from 1886 to 1916). An elevator carries visitors to the observation deck in the pedestal, which may also be reached by stairway, and a spiral staircase leads to an observation platform in the figure’s crown. A plaque at the pedestal’s entrance is inscribed with a sonnet, “The New Colossus” (1883) by Emma Lazarus.

            Grand Canyon National Park
        </h3>
       
        <p>
            Nothing can quite prepare a person for the awe-inspiring grandeur of one of the most famous places in the world. The Grand Canyon winds for 277 miles (446) km across northwestern Arizona in an intricately carved chasm of imposing peaks, buttes, gorges, and ravines in layers of red, buff and gray, delicate green and pink, brown, slate gray, and purple rock—all formed over millions of years. Great crowds of people from throughout the world come to see this marvel each year. Most visitors peer over the rim from up top to the canyon floor a mile below. The more hardy souls hike or ride donkeys down to the bottom and then must hike back up. The lucky ones experience the floor of the canyon from rafts that float down the Colorado River.

            Golden Gate Bridge
        </h3>

        <p>
           Golden Gate Bridge, suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate in California to link San Francisco with Marin county to the north. Upon its completion in 1937, it was the tallest and longest suspension bridge in the world. The Golden Gate Bridge came to be recognized as a symbol of the power and progress of the United States, and it set a precedent for suspension-bridge design around the world. Although other bridges have since surpassed it in size, it remains incomparable in the magnificence of its setting and is said to be the most photographed bridge in the world. It carries both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 (Pacific Coast Highway) across the strait and features a pedestrian walkway.

            Niagara Falls
        </h3>
        
        <p> 
            Niagara Falls, city and port, Niagara county, western New York, U.S. It lies at the great falls of the Niagara River, opposite the city of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and about 8 miles (15 km) northwest of Buffalo. The British built Fort Schlosser there in 1761, and in 1805 or 1806 Augustus Porter established a grist mill and a settlement called Manchester. Both the settlement and the fort were burned by the British during the War of 1812, but development of the surrounding farmlands continued; the villages of Manchester, Suspension Bridge, and Clarksville (later to merge into Niagara Falls) grew up along the river. The Niagara River’s hydroelectric potential began to be developed in 1881, and, with the formation of the Niagara Falls Power Company in 1878, the industrial future of the city was assured. Its hydroelectric plants supply power to much of New York state and to the city’s electrochemical, electrometallurgical, and aerospace industries. Other economically important manufactures include paper, abrasives, machinery, electrical equipment, and food products.

            Mount Rushmore
        </h3>

        <p>
            Mount Rushmore National Memorial, colossal sculpture in the Black Hills of southwestern South Dakota, U.S. It lies about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Rapid City, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Custer, and just north of Custer State Park. Huge representations of the heads of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, each about 60 feet (18 meters) tall, are carved in granite on the southeast side of Mount Rushmore. The mountain itself, at an elevation of 5,725 feet (1,745 meters), was named in 1885 for Charles E. Rushmore, a New York lawyer. The memorial, which covers 2 square miles (5 square km), was designated in 1925 and dedicated in 1927. The U.S. National Park Service (NPS) assumed administration of the site in 1933.

        <h3>General Tips</h3>
        <p>Always carry valid identification, especially when traveling between states or entering certain buildings. Tipping is expected in restaurants, cafes, taxis, and hotels. Distances between cities are large, so plan flights or long drives ahead of time. Follow local laws closely, as rules can vary by state. Weather can change a lot, so check forecasts before traveling.</p>
