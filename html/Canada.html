       <h1>Canada</h1>
    </div>

    <h2 class="history">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Canada, the second largest country in the world in area (after Russia), occupying roughly the northern two-fifths of the continent of North America.Canada is officially bilingual in English and French, reflecting the country’s history as ground once contested by two of Europe’s great powers.The national capital is Ottawa, Canada’s fourth largest city.
    </p>

    <h2 class="history">Culture</h2>
    <p>In 1951 the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters, and Sciences issued a report (what became known as the Massey Report) warning that Canadian culture had become invisible, nearly indistinguishable from that of the neighbouring United States, owing to years of “American invasion by film, radio, and periodical.” Henceforth, the government declared that Canada’s mass media would be required to encourage Canadian content—books, television programs, magazines, and other locally made cultural products. By most accounts, the policy has been quite successful, though that success has largely been the result of individual not federal efforts.In its broadest sense, Canadian culture is a mixture of British, French, and American influences, all of which blend and sometimes compete in every aspect of cultural life, from filmmaking and writing to cooking and playing sports. Other peoples have added distinctive elements to this mixture.</p>
    
    <p><b>Thanksgiving Day</b>, annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year. It is observed on the second Monday in October in Canada. Thanksgiving is a day when families and friends gather to express gratitude for the year’s blessings over a shared feast. The holiday has evolved from a harvest celebration to a national tradition of togetherness and thankfulness through centuries of tradition building, mythmaking, and cultural change.Days of thanksgiving in Canada also originated in the colonial period, arising from the same European traditions, in gratitude for safe journeys, peace, and bountiful harvests. The earliest celebration took place in 1578, when an expedition led by Martin Frobisher held a ceremony in present-day Nunavut to give thanks for the safety of its fleet. In 1879 Parliament established a national Thanksgiving Day on November 6; the date has varied over the years.</p>

    <p><b>Canada Day</b>, the national holiday of Canada. It is celebrated with parades, displays of the flag, the singing of the national anthem, “O Canada,” and fireworks. When July 1 falls on a Sunday, the holiday is observed on the following day.</p>

    <h2 class="food">Food/Cuisine</h2>
    
    <p><b>Poutine</b> is a Canadian dish made of french fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. It first appeared in 1950s rural Québec snack bars and was widely popularized across Canada and beyond in the 1990s. Poutine may be found everywhere from fine dining menus at top restaurants to fast-food chains. It has become a symbol of Québécois and Canadian cuisine and culture.</p>
    
    <p><b>Maple syrup</b> is a classic Canadian product made from the sap of maple trees. It is often poured over pancakes, waffles, and French toast. Canada produces most of the world’s maple syrup, making it an important part of Canadian food culture.</p>

    <p><b>Butter tarts</b> are a traditional Canadian dessert. They have a flaky pastry shell filled with a sweet mixture of butter, sugar, and eggs. Some versions include raisins or nuts. They are common at bakeries and family gatherings.</p>

    <p><b>Tourtière</b> is a meat pie that comes from French Canadian cuisine. It is usually filled with ground pork or beef mixed with spices. It is often served during holidays, especially around Christmas.</p>

    <p><b>Nanaimo bars</b> are a no bake dessert from British Columbia. They have three layers, a chocolate and coconut base, a creamy custard filling, and a chocolate topping. They are popular across Canada.</p>

    <p><b>Smoked salmon</b> is especially popular on the west coast of Canada. It is made by curing and smoking fresh salmon, giving it a rich flavor. It is often eaten on bread, crackers, or as part of a meal.</p>

    <p><b>Peameal bacon</b> is a Canadian style of bacon made from lean pork loin. It is cured and rolled in cornmeal. It is commonly served in sandwiches and is especially popular in Ontario.</p>

    <h2 class="history">History</h2>
    <p>
        North America’s first humans migrated from Asia, presumably over a now-submerged land bridge from Siberia to Alaska sometime about 12,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age; it has also been argued, however, that some people arrived earlier, possibly up to 60,000 years ago. Unknown numbers of people moved southward along the western edge of the North American ice cap. The presence of the ice, which for a time virtually covered Canada, makes it reasonable to assume that the southern reaches of North America were settled before Canada, and that the Inuit who live in Canada’s Arctic regions today were the last of the aboriginal peoples to reach Canada. There is general agreement that Native American peoples are related to Asian peoples and that the closest resemblances are between North American Arctic peoples and their counterparts in Siberia.

    <h2 class="places-title">Sights/Attractions</h2>

    <h3>Bay of Fundy</h3>
    <p> 
        Bay of Fundy, inlet of the Atlantic Ocean between the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick (north and west) and Nova Scotia (south and east). It extends 94 miles (151 km) inland, is 32 miles (52 km) wide at its entrance, and is noted for its fast-running tides, which may produce rises as great as 70 feet (21 meters), the highest in the world. Aside from the spectacular rock formations and forests of its shorelines and the fine agricultural lands created by dikes from its on-land marshes, the bay has come into prominence as a major potential source of hydroelectricity, but one that continues to present great engineering difficulties and other problems of feasibility.

    <h3>Niagara Falls</h3>
    <p>
        Niagara Falls, city, regional municipality of Niagara, southeastern Ontario, Canada. It lies on the west bank of the Niagara River, opposite Niagara Falls, New York.Development of the city, which was named Elgin in 1853, began with the completion in 1855 of the first suspension bridge across the Niagara gorge. The city was renamed Clifton in 1856 and received its present name in 1881. In 1963 it merged with Stamford Township, increasing its area 12-fold. The city’s importance is due largely to the Niagara Falls cataract, which is a major source of electrical power for Ontario and is one of North America’s most popular tourist attractions. Now connected to Niagara Falls, New York, by three bridges, including the Rainbow and Whirlpool Rapids bridges, the city is also a customs port and an industrial centre. Manufactures include electrochemicals, fertilizers, abrasives and refractories, silverware, cereals, machinery, sporting equipment, paper goods, and food products. Queen Victoria Park stretches along the bank of the river above and below the falls and includes the Oakes Garden Theatre. Inc. 1904. Pop. (2006) 82,184; St. Catherines–Niagara metro. area, 390,317; (2011) 82,997; St. Catherines–Niagara metro. area, 392,184.

    <h3>Toronto</h3>
    <p>
        Toronto, city, capital of the province of Ontario, southeastern Canada. It is the most populous city in Canada, a multicultural city, and the country’s financial and commercial center. Its location on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario, which forms part of the border between Canada and the United States, and its access to Atlantic shipping via the St. Lawrence Seaway and to major U.S. industrial centers via the Great Lakes have enabled Toronto to become an important international trading center. Moreover, the city is positioned on the edge of some of the best farmland in Canada, with a climate favorable to growing a wide range of crops, thereby making Toronto a transportation, distribution, and manufacturing center. Most importantly, its central location, along with a host of political policies favoring international trade, places this city with the greatest economic ties to, and influence from, the United States. Since the second half of the 20th century the city has grown phenomenally, from a rather sedate provincial town—“Toronto the Good”—to a lively, thriving, cosmopolitan metropolitan area. Area 244 square miles (632 square km); metro. area, 2,280 square miles (5,905 square km). Pop. (2011) 2,615,060; metro. area, 5,583,064; (2021) 2,794,356; metro. area, 6,202,225.

    <h3>Ottawa</h3>
    <p>
        Ottawa, city, capital of Canada, located in southeastern Ontario. In the eastern extreme of the province, Ottawa is situated on the south bank of the Ottawa River across from Gatineau, Quebec, at the confluence of the Ottawa (Outaouais), Gatineau, and Rideau rivers. The Ottawa River (some 790 miles [1,270 km] long), the principal tributary of the St. Lawrence River, was a key factor in the city’s settlement and development; its watershed, covering more than 57,000 square miles (148,000 square km), facilitated the transport of resources such as furs, timber, and minerals from the region. The river’s Chaudière Falls, just west of the Rideau Canal, while initially a navigational hazard for the fur trade and later for the transport of logging rafts, ultimately proved to be an asset in the production of hydroelectric power for the city and a boon to the growth of industry.
