    <h2 class="history">About Egypt</h2>
    <p>Egypt's civilization began when Narmer (also known as Menes) unified Upper and Lower Egypt around 3150 BC, founding the first of many dynasties. The fertile banks of Nile River allowed agriculture to flourish, which supported the rise of an advanced civilization — with monumental architecture, writing (hieroglyphs), and organized society.</p>

    <h2 class="places-title">Top Destinations</h2>

    <h3>1. Visit the Pyramids of Giza</h3>
    <img src="../images/Pyramids-Giza-Cairo-Egypt.webp" alt="Pyramids Giza">
    <p>The Pyramids of Giza, along with the Sphinx and a handful of smaller tombs, form one of the most iconic sights in the world.</p>

    <h3>2. Explore Historic Cairo</h3>
    <img src="../images/182391445-The-Grand-Egyptian-Museum-In-Cairo.jpg" alt="Cairo">
    <p>Cairo is the capital of Egypt. It is located on the Nile River, right where the desert transitions into the Nile Delta.</p>

    <h3>3. Visit Alexandria</h3>
    <img src="../images/stanly-bridge-alexandria-city-egypt-harbor-aerial-cruise.jpg" alt="Alexandria">
    <p>Located on the Mediterranean Sea, Alexandria is the second largest city in Egypt and a popular tourist destination. You can visit Alexandria on a day trip from Cairo or spend a night or two in the city.</p>

    <h3>4. Tomb of Nefertari</h3>
    <img src="../images/Nefertari-Tomb-Valley-of-the-Queens-1129x753.jpg.optimal.jpg" alt="Nefertari">
    <p>The Valley of the Queens was the burial site of the wives of the pharaohs. The tombs that you will see here are smaller and lack some of the grandeur of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings, with one big exception.</p>

    <h3>5. The Nile River</h3>
    <img src="../images/Kiosk-Roman-island-Trajan-Agilkia-Nile-River.webp" alt="Nile River">
    <p>Drifting on the Nile River, past the ancient tombs and temples, is one of Egypt’s top experiences. Most cruises sail between Aswan and Luxor, with visits to Esna, Edfu, and Kom Ombo along the way.</p>

    <h2 class="food">Egyptian Cuisine</h2>

    <h3>Koshari</h3>
    <img src="../images/food_1.webp" alt="Koshari">
    <p>A famous Egyptian street food made with rice, lentils, pasta, chickpeas, crispy fried onions, and a tangy tomato sauce with vinegar.</p>

    <h3>Full Medames</h3>
    <img src="../images/foul-mudammas-recipe-8.jpg" alt="Full Medames">
    <p>Slow-cooked fava beans served with olive oil, lemon juice, cumin, and sometimes eggs or vegetables.</p>

    <h3>Molokhia</h3>
    <img src="../images/food_2.webp" alt="Molokhia">
    <p>A green soup/stew made from jute leaves, cooked with garlic and coriander, often served with chicken or rabbit and eaten with rice or bread.</p>
